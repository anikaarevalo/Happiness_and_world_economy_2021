# ðŸ˜ŠðŸ“ŠThe relatiopnship between happiness and global economic development for year 2021

## Description ##

<p><strong>What is happiness and what are the keys to a happy life?</strong>  Ask anyone and they would most probably tell you that the achievement of happiness (or the 'good life') gives meaning to human lives the world over. But what precisely are the variables directly linked to our achievement of happiness or wellbeing?</p><p><em>Can happiness be quantified or measured--and if so, is it a phenomenon directly shaped by classic economic forces behind material wealth or prosperity, e.g. <strong>GDP</strong>?</em> Although there are several types of analyses and correlations that we can perform to gain insights into the happiness trends, and relationships between different variables contributing to economic development on a global scale, the attributes in play only become concretely significant understood within the context of a <strong>nation's overall happiness score</strong>.</p><p>Discussions on 'happiness' may be replete in Psychology, Philosophy, and the Humanities, but what positive socio-economic conditions can we statistically infer (or predict) with our analysis of GDP-related data?</p>

<p>Deploying the corresponding Python-based libraries and modules, we'll apply the following data analysis methods and extract the following statistical analyses in order to generate the answers we are seeking from the available data on global happiness and the international economy:</p>

1) Data transformation with Pandas
2) Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
3) Machine learning with TensorFlow
4) Probablity distrubtion and the Central Limit Theorem using SciPy

<p>With the general classification of 'Univariate' and 'Multivariate' analyses, here are some basic statistical investigations that we'll be exploring with our data:</p> 

Univariate:

1) Determining the GDP trends across years
2) Examining distribution of happiness scores across regions
3) Distribution of GDP values for each country individually
4) Happiness (Ladder) Score and (Healthy) Life Expectancy
5) GDP and (Healthy) Life Expectancy

Multivariate:
6) Happiness (Ladder) Score vis-a-vis GDP
7) Considering a third varliable: Happiness (Ladder) Score, GDP, and Generosity 

As an amateur philosopher and data science practitioner, this project is both personal and professional in significance. At this stage of the product cycle development, the **end-users** who come to mind are fellow ethusiasts who believe that living well is as much a matter of individual determination, as well as a collective phenomenon that can be scientifically quantified.
