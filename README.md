# ðŸ˜ŠðŸ“ŠThe relationship between happiness and global economic development for year 2021

## Description ##

<em>Can happiness be quantified--and if so, is it a phenomenon directly shaped by classic economic forces behind material prosperity, e.g. <strong>GDP</strong>?</em> Discussions on 'happiness' may be replete in Psychology, Philosophy, and the Humanities, but what positive socio-economic conditions can we statistically infer (or predict) with our analysis of GDP-related data in relation to measures of overall collective wellbeing?</p><p><strong>What is happiness and what are the keys to a happy life?</strong>  We all want to achieve happiness, but many do not know precisely what the variables resulting to a happy life are.</p><p>Deploying the corresponding Python-based libraries and modules, we'll apply the following data analysis methods and extract the following statistical analyses in order to generate the answers we are seeking from the available data on global happiness and the international economy:</p>

1) Data transformation with Pandas
2) Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

<p>Using a classification between 'Univariate' and 'Multivariate' analyses, here are some basic statistical investigations that we'll be exploring with our data:</p> 

Univariate:

1) Determining the GDP trends across years
2) Determining distribution of happiness scores across regions


Multivariate:

3) Examining the relationship between GDP, (Healthy) Life Expectancy, and Regional indicator
4) Examining the relationship between Happiness raking, (Healthy) Life Expectancy, and Regional indicator
5) Examining the relationship between Happiness ranking, GDP, and Regional indicator
6) 'Giving' as a third varliable: Inferring the relationship between/among Happiness score, GDP, and 'Generosity'


At this stage of the project, the **audience** who come to mind are peers who believe that achieving happiness is as much a matter of individual determination, as well as a shared human endeavour that can be scientifically defined and tracked.

## Personal situation ##

This project puts into practice the conventional Data Science workflow that focuses on the key methods of data transformation, data exploration, and data analysis. In this regard, I deployed performant Python-based libraries and module to leverage basic statistical operations and communicate results.

The scope of the tasks in this project is limited to statistical analyses of the data to generate measures of spread, distribution, and the correlation coefficient. Identifying and modeling non-linear relationships is as well crucial in performing statistical investiations on real-world data. A logical <b>next step</b> in this project is to <b>capture and analyze more non-linear correlations in the data</b> by employing various statistical methods and machine learning techniques, such as polynomial regression, spline regression, and non-linear regression models.
