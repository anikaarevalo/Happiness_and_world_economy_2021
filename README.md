# ðŸ˜ŠðŸ“ŠCorrelation between happiness and economic development for year 2021

## Description ##

<p><strong>What is happiness and what are the keys to a happy life?</strong> We lead our lives for the most part believing that it's the attainment of'happiness' (or the 'good life') which gives meaning and direction to our respective and varied earthly pursuits. But what precisely are the variables directly linked to our achievement of wellbeing?</p><p><em>Can happiness be quantified or measured--and if so, is it a phenomenon directly shaped by classic economic forces behind material wealth or prosperity, e.g. <strong>GDP</strong>?</em> Although there are several types of correlations and analyses that we can perform to gain insights into the economic trends and relationships between different variables contributing to economic development, the attributes in play only become concretely relatable understood within the context of a <strong>nation's overall happiness score</strong>.</p><p>Discussions on 'happiness' may be replete in Psychology, Philosophy, and the Humanities, but what social conditions can we statistically infer (or predict) with our analysis of GDP-related data?</p><p>To this end, we'll apply specific data analysis methods and extract statistical correlations in order to give way to the answers and the insights we are seeking from the available data on global happiness and the international economy.<p>To raise the complexity of our data analysis goals, we'll also leverage on different statistical and machine learning techniques.</p>

<p>Here are some common correlations and analyses that we'll be exploring with our data:</p> 

1) GDP growth rates
2) Correlation of GDP with other economic indicators
3) Long-term economic trends
4) Forecasting

As an amateur philosopher and data science practitioner, this project is both personal and professional in significance. At this stage of the product cycle development, the **end-users** who come to mind are fellow ethusiasts who believe that living well is as much a matter of individual determination, as well as a phenomenon that can be scientifically quantified.
